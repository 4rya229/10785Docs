Dear \[something],

  

I am writing on behalf of the Governor Livingston High School Robotics Team from Berkeley Heights, NJ. We compete in the FIRST Tech Challenge, a worldwide robotics competition. Our team reached the state championship last year, and we are now setting our sights on reaching the world championship. Unfortunately, we are currently facing a significant obstacle. Our budget has been cut by 60%, severely limiting our ability to pursue our goals. This reduction impacts our capacity to purchase necessary parts and materials for our robots and conduct community outreach programs.

  

As a leading technology company in our community, Fiserv’s sponsorship would aid us in providing the necessary financial backing. Furthermore, the Fiserv logo on team kits, on the robot, and across our stands would improve the team and Fiserv equally.

  

We would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss this partnership further. 

  

Thank you very much for your time.

  

Sincerely,

The Governor Livingston High School Robotics Team

Berkeley Heights, NJ
